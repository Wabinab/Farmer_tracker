# Example Logfile

This is an example logfile. Based on this log, some update have been updated. Example, previously we answer
"Cannot find any transfer. Manual checking required" for DDOS attack prevention from site that causes it.
However, one now changes it to include the account name so you can come back later to deal with it.

**Though, these fails one we haven't implement adding them to list automatically yet**.

Some other logs are from Selenium, which doesn't make much sense but you can ignore it as long as the website
works well.
